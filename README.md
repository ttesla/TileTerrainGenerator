# Tilemap Terrain Generator
Tilemap terrain generator with wave function collapse algorithm.

I did some reading about the Wave Function Collapse tilemap generation algorithm. Almost everything about the algorithm can be found in Maxim Gumin's [github repo](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse). 
And terrain, city generation wizard Oskar Stalberg's [Wave demo](https://oskarstalberg.com/game/wave/wave.html) helped me to visualize the algorithm. 

Then I did this little demo.
